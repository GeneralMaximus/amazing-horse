Look at my horse my horse is amazing
Give it a lick Mmm it tastes just like raisins
Stroke on it's mane it turns into a plane
And then it turns back again when you tug on its winky
Eww that's dirty!
Do you think so? Well I better not show you where the lemonade is made
Sweet Lemonade Mmm Sweet lemonade
Sweet lemonade yeah sweet lemonade
(Synth Solo)
Get on my horse I'll take you round the Universe and all the other places too
I think you'll find that the Universe pretty much covers everything
Shut up woman get on my horse
